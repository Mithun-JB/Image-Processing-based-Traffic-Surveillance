# Image-Processing-based-Traffic-Surveillance
The project aims to revolutionize traffic law enforcement using an automated surveillance system driven by image processing. It extracts license plate information of vehicles violating traffic rules, achieving high detection accuracy with YOLOv8 and OpenALPR models. This technology enhances road safety by consistently enforcing traffic rules.
